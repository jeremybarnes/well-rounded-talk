  \item Creativity: language manipulation (``I did not...'')? (check)
  \item Personality: Steamy romps with interns? (check)
  \item Knowledge: 
  \item \alert{Culture and Personality}: Plays the saxophone? (check)

Playing the saxophone makes Bill Clinton more cultured and personable, and came to define him as a person.

This makes him more well-rounded to people, which helped him to win elections.

It's worth trying to be well-rounded.

You can get a lot of knowledge and culture with Python.

But don't stop there!
